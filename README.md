Finally it's C/C++ that matters

### Back to Hometown

C++ was my first language when I started my career as a programmer.
I learned it from Chris Watkiss @Capilano College in 1997. I used to work on C/C++ for my projects @Samsung but it was very limited and I didn't have any projects to practice full hands-on experience. 

It was the Hackrrank competition which I seriously start considering to switch my professional main language from Java/Python to C++ for  many reasons.
