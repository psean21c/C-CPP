Finally it's C/C++ that matters

### Back to Hometown

C++ was my first language when I started my career as a programmer.
I learned it from Chris Watkiss @Capilano College in 1997. I used to work on C/C++ for my projects @Samsung but it was very limited and they didn't give me full hands-on experience. It is the Hackrrank competition which I seriously start considering to switch my professional main languages from Java/Python to C++ because of many reasons.
